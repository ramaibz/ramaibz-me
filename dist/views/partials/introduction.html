      Not actually fresh though. I'm graduated in 2013, doing freelance stuff since 2011. But, today and onwards, i want to extend my knowledge which i couldn't get from just being a freelancer, by joining a company or a startup who had many experienced people who aim towards the better future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my sparetime, i'm learning English, Svenska, German, Arabic and Japanese. Being a polyglot is my another sidekick mission to fullfil my outrageous dream.

      My learning style that fit me best is somewhat a style which includes physical activity, or learning by teacher, example even mistake. Learning by just reading alone will take a tremendeous time for me.
